**Python utilities to set up and analyze Modelica simulation experiments**

ModelicaRes is a free, open-source tool to manage Modelica_ simulations,
interpret results, and create publishable figures.  It is currently possible to

- Auto-generate simulation scripts,
- Run model executables with varying parameters,
- Browse data,
- Perform custom calculations, and
- Produce various plots and diagrams.

The figures are generated via matplotlib_, which offers a rich set of plotting
routines.  ModelicaRes includes convenient functions to automatically pre-format
and label some figures, like xy plots, Bode and Nyquist plots, and Sankey
diagrams.  ModelicaRes can be scripted or run from a Python_ interpreter with
math and matrix functions from NumPy_.

  The links below describe the components of ModelicaRes.  The top-level module,
  :mod:`modelicares`, provides direct access to the most important classes and
  functions.  Others must be accessed through their submodules.  The
  :mod:`loadres` script loads data files and provides a Python_ interpreter to
  help analyze them.  The :mod:`modelicares.simres` submodule has classes to
  load, analyze, and plot simulation results.  The :mod:`modelicares.linres`
  submodule has a class to load, analyze, and plot results from linearizing a
  model.  The :mod:`modelicares.multi` submodule has functions to load and plot
  results from multiple data files at once.  The :mod:`modelicares.exps`
  submodule has tools to set up and manage simulation experiments.  The
  :mod:`modelicares.texunit` submodule has functions to translate Modelica_
  *unit* and *displayUnit* strings into LaTeX_-formatted strings.  The last
  submodule, :mod:`modelicares.base`, has general supporting functions.

  **Installation**

  An installable copy of this package can be downloaded from the `main site
  <http://kdavies4.github.io/ModelicaRes/>`_ or the `PyPI page`_.  After
  extracting the package, run the set-up script (setup.py) from the base folder.
  On Windows, use the following command::

     python setup.py install

  On Linux, use::

     sudo python setup.py install

  The matplotlibrc file in the base folder has some recommended revisions to
  matplotlib_'s defaults.  To use it, copy or move the file to the working
  directory or matplotlib_'s configuration directory.  See
  http://matplotlib.org/users/customizing.html for details.
